## Simple Summary

To advance the NewChain development, the original NEW release plan of the community (60% of 100B total supply) will be changed

## Abstract

The total supply of NEW is 100B, 60% of which is subjected to the community.

It can be divided into three parts as below:

1. already released: 1545232707.3505096555 NEW
2. 2021/2/1-2022/1/31 for incentives: 875130267.8946381786 NEW
3. the rest: 57579637024.7548521659 NEW

The seconds part will be used for supporting the Newton Incentive Program.

## Newton Incentive Program

The current NewPay node stake mining will be ended by 2020/2, then a Newton Incentive Program will be initiated:

Program budget: the same as above, No. 2

Themes:
| *No* | *Mining Theme* | *Incentivized Behavior* | *Budget Allocation* |
