## Simple Summary

Referring to [NEP-40](https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-40/), the release schedule for 2022 NEW is now planned.
The overall release curve is the same as the established one.

## Motivation

To better enhance the value of Newton and activate the community, the NEW release for 2022 is now planned according to NEP-40.
According to [NEP-45](https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-45/), ledger nodes will have some incentives.
In the past year, the ledger nodes have served to protect the network.

Currently, there are 69 active NEW DAOs on Newton, which enrich Newton's community building and eco-governance. The award to NEW DAO will be maintained in 2022.

To better improve the mobility of NEW and the richness of Newton's ecology, increase the incentives for NewBridge and NewMall.
